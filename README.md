# Gulp Settings
My gulp settings for front end development

Move this to your theme directory, then just run `npm-install`. It will read your package.json file and install all modules needed to run this.

Once that's installed, just run the following commands:
```$gulp | runs all gulp tasks once
$gulp watch | constantly runs gulp and watches any changed files```
